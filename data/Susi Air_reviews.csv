Try to finish your course at the Embry Riddle University that you left unattended. ","The management is not making the correct decisions at Susi Air, they rules the company with an iron hand and he doesn't listen to any advice. They are very rude to his employees so he is not liked by them and even less by his pilots.
Here I wrote some lines for future aviators who want to join Susi Air after 2020:
- THE MANAGEMENT IS ASKING CURRENT AND FORMER EMPLOYEES TO GIVE 5 STARS REVIEWS IN GLASSDOOR, SO DON'T TRUST ANY 5 STAR REVIEW AFTER 2020. ACTUALLY I WAS CONTACTED BY THE MANAGEMENT TO DO A 5 STAR REVIEW BUT I CONSIDERED UNFAIR AFTER ALL THAT IS GOING ON IN THE COMPANY.
- The management is appointing relatives in the Susi Air administration. So be careful they have eyes and ears everywhere. 
- The Training department is upgrading pilots who stall airplanes in the simulator right after take off, even one new captain stalled an airplane in the ILS, the Training standards have lowered considerably since the new management took over the pilot training department.
- You have to pay for all your caravan training, so is a Pay to fly scheme. the total cost is more than 8000 USD.
- There is no maintenance for the airplanes, Susi Air is barely following the engine manufacture standards for engine maintenance. They force you to pass notes to maintenance in a separate paper instead of logging in the maintenance logbook. As well some of the maintenance stuff that they called themselves engineers doesn't have any license to work as an aircraft engineer. By the way they sometimes hire maintenance personnel from Facebook....
- The safety department is totally corrupted by the management. If you do a safety report you will be invited to leave the company immediately. 
- If you are not a friend of the administration your life as a pilot will be as hell. No holidays approval, random schedule changes during days off, and other types of nightmares. 
- One pilot resigned before starting his training and he was asked for his passport for ""visa cancellation"", but it was not true. The real story is he was forced to pay his training bond to recover his passport. 
- They are hiring pilots with doubtful logbooks from doggy countries.
- If they give you an Indonesian pilot License you will be forced to give it back to the company.
- They pay you in Indonesian rupiah at an unfair rate. The rate they pay you is 13,500 IDR while the correct rate is 16,240 IDR.
- no health insurance
- very shady work visa where you have to leave the country every year and need to give your passport to the ""visas services guy"" in a fast food restaurant.
- All the pilots are leaving Susi Air to other aviation companies even a few resigned with no other job offer after suffering all I wrote before. 
- STAY AWAY FROM SUSI AIR !!!!",15,"{'id': 545277, 'shortName': 'Susi Air', 'squareLogoUrl': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/545277/susi-air-squarelogo-1585309224851.png'}",[],False,False,True,{'text': 'Captain'},4,"{'id': 2696716, 'name': 'Pangandaran', 'type': 'CITY'}",I am afraid they are NO pros in this company.

EmployerReviewRG,"please hear your pilots, look where are you standing... you already had two Porter Pilatus plane crashes and nothing has been done.","After reading the last two posts from colleagues flying in susi air while they are looking for a new job, I encourage myself to write a report here because the management corrupted the safety department. Lately, someone made a safety report anonymously because he feared the consequences from the management, and the French general manager together with the Spanish operations manager forced the safety manager to give the name of the pilot who submitted the report. I have been in susi air for a couple of years and changed a lot. New management arrived in 2020 with an iron hand giving no-sense orders that cost a lot of money to the company, they are compromising the safety of the flight forcing pilots to fly above 100 hours per month. The Engineers are leaving susi air because of the maintenance manager, by the way, he doesnâ€™t have any license so he forces other engineers to sign the maintenance logbooks of the planes. A pilot was kidnapped and the management doesnâ€™t even care about him, they just give a nonsense report saying that they are doing all they can to rescue him. It has been already more than 3 months and nothing is being done. The last salary increase was in 2009, we are getting paid in Indonesian rupiah at an unfair rate established by the company, As well regarding payments we are getting paid in two different bank accounts to evade taxes to the Indonesian government, we do not have health insurance (the company on this topic says that susi air can pay all the medical costs in case you are injured but only during work). New pilots are bonded with 4000 USD, and they are scheduled to clean toilets and the garden at the main base. The building where the trainees are staying looks more like a refugee camp than a compound, there is no hot water and they force you to share rooms and toilets in unhealthy conditions. If you are a pilot with low hours looking for a job do not come here! Safety is compromised, and your life is in danger on every flight due to, they will force you to fly in bad weather conditions, in planes fixed with duct tape with altered maintenance logbooks, they will force you to fly above your hoursâ€™ limitations, and you will be scheduled in dodgy places like Papua where there is a war between Papuans and the Indonesian government.",10,"{'id': 545277, 'shortName': 'Susi Air', 'squareLogoUrl': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/545277/susi-air-squarelogo-1585309224851.png'}",[],False,False,True,{'text': 'Captain'},6,"{'id': 2709872, 'name': 'Jakarta', 'type': 'CITY'}","Pilot community, we help each other in this horrible company",NEGATIVE,1.0,,1.0,1,1,1,NEGATIVE,1.0,1.0,2023-06-03T06:48:29.563,77039815,Do not risk your life and go to other operator!!!
