EmployerReviewRG,,"While there are many advantages to working at Gojek, it's important to consider some potential challenges and drawbacks as well. Here are some cons to keep in mind: - Intense Workload: As a leading technology company, Gojek operates in a highly competitive and fast-paced industry. The workload can be demanding and may require long working hours, especially during peak periods or when handling critical projects. This intensity can sometimes lead to high levels of stress and pressure. - Work-Life Balance Challenges: Despite efforts to promote work-life balance, the nature of Gojek's operations and the need to meet customer demands can occasionally make it challenging to maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life. Achieving a sustainable equilibrium may require effective time management and prioritization. - Uncertainty and Adaptability: The technology industry is known for its rapid changes and evolving trends. Gojek, being at the forefront of innovation, operates in a dynamic environment where strategies, projects, and priorities may shift frequently.

Multiple teams, departments, and stakeholders may be involved in decision-making processes, which can sometimes slow down progress or create bureaucracy. This complexity may require employees to be proactive in seeking clarity and collaboration. - High Expectations: Gojek sets high expectations for its employees to maintain its competitive edge in the market. The company has a performance-driven culture that expects individuals to consistently deliver exceptional results. While this can be motivating, it may also create additional pressure to meet and exceed expectations. - Limited Career Growth Opportunities: While Gojek offers various career paths and development programs, the rapid growth of the company may result in limited upward mobility opportunities for all employees. Advancement to senior leadership positions might be competitive and dependent on factors such as organizational needs, performance, and market conditions. - Work-Related Stress: Working in a fast-paced and high-pressure environment can lead to increased levels of stress and burnout.

EmployerReviewRG,"I think we should really take a serious look at our people practices, which are clearly broken, and improve the transparency of our processes. The way in which the layoff was done clearly shows that something has gone badly wrong, and needs a lot of improvement. Morale and faith in the management are at an all time low.","I really like Gojek, and I really like the people I work with and the projects I've worked on, so it breaks my heart to write this.

 I want to give a clear understanding of what to expect when someone joins 

I'm writing this review 2 days after Gojek executed layoffs of ~10% of the staff or around 1300 people. 

A lot of designers were also badly affected. There were multiple leaks to the media beforehand that the management either denied or refused to comment on, and then all of a sudden without warning conducted it.

They conducted the layoffs very badly, announcing it in the morning, and then we had to wait the entire day to know if our role was safe or not. It was a very cruel and anxiety inducing way to do the layoff, and those who remain are stressed and demoralised. 

The reason they did this layoff was because they had made really bad financial decisions and were running at heavy losses, and were under pressure to reach profitability. 

And this is the big con of Gojek - the company is very quick to layoff people. It's happened 3 times (2019, 2020 and 2022) and each time it's been badly handled. The way they have botched this layoff, and the less-than-generous severance and benefits should be a pause for anyone who wants to join in the future. 

More than that, there are some big organisational issues with how the recruitment and HR functions work. The comp bands are very wide, and there is an opaque negotiation process where the negotiator aggressively tries to benchmark your compensation to what you were earning in your previous job. 

People end up leaving money on the table, and those who are more aggressive or able to game the system are the ones who win out. Further the performance review and bell curving unfairly penalises new joiners.

 At the time of year end performance review, I like to think I performed very well, as per my stakeholder reviews, and the designs that I shipped, but I was rated a 3 out of 5 (Meets Expectations). My manager said they couldn’t do anything because I had been at Gojek for less than a year and the maximum rating I am allowed is 3. This seems to be an unwritten rule, and in my opinion it is very stupid. 

If the maximum is a 3, then why allow PMR for people before one year at all? this kind of bell curving and being force fitted a grade, despite manager’s own recommendation just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn’t complain so much, but my bonus was dependent on my performance review, and I lose money because of this policy. 

Then I finished a year around the time of the mid-year review. My manager then told me that a HR rule was that I had to finish a year’s worth of appraisal cycles. This meant to be considered for a promotion, I had to wait 18 months for the second end of year cycle to be considered for a promotion, when I had joined underleveled anyway. 

Gojek also claims to have a Learning and Development budget but in practice it's implemented very badly - 3 of us from our team applied for a grant to attend a conference. Part of the process means you pay in advance and get reimbursed. I alone from my team mates did not get reimbursed due to some technical issue by the HR. So I was out a substantial amount of money for the conference. My manager felt bad about it, and tried to pay me from his own pocket - which is insane. 

As an employee, giving referrals is a painful enough process that I've stopped doing it. Recruiters ignore referrals for weeks, or ghost the candidates I refer, leading to them being upset at me, and negatively affecting my reputation. 

Finally the org has a shiny object syndrome, leading to reorganisations every six months, and a lot of confusion internally as to what initiatives to be focused on. In my time here, I have experienced 3 reorgs.",6,"{'id': 1282114, 'shortName': 'Gojek', 'squareLogoUrl': 'https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/1282114/go-jek-squarelogo-1564047055986.png'}",[],False,False,True,{'text': 'Product Designer'},2,"{'id': 2940587, 'name': 'Bengaluru', 'type': 'CITY'}","For a product designer, Gojek is a great place to be.

Promotions are often arbitrarily denied and managers tend to act helpless in the matter citing the whims of 'powers that be'.

My advice would be to not stick around more than a year and a half. Leave soon after you hear a flimsy excuse or any grand promises about the 'next performance cycle'
- Significant disparity in pay within the same org level. The org overtly advocates salary parity but salary bands are not public information. You may find yourself grossly underpaid (sometimes well below your org-mandated salary band) compared to other colleagues at the same level if you don't keep your ear to the ground.

Respect people, what you hired them for!","Slow, repetitive, mundane work.  People talk more than the action.

Don’t see any tech and product vision from the leadership, which can generate any interesting challenging work, to keep senior talent engaged.

Not so great people at the helm, who are unwilling to be receptive, for the ideas, experience brought in, by the newcomers.

Overly visible strong groupism, within the old timers, elevated to higher roles, ensues non-transparent, closed-door decision making. If you are a newcomer, the chances of you growing into the organization, being listened to, the feeling being part of the organization, are miniscule. Ones’ opinions, experience they brought in, are conveniently ignored and un-welcomed, most of the times. 

No clear job definition, role for the individuals - especially for the senior profiles, on “the pretext” of flat hierarchy. That a LIE!! Beware, there does exist hierarchy and labels, which are never spoken about and bestowed upon select group. You feel cheated, once you join the organization. A senior developer ends up doing same task as a fresher. Utterly wasteful!

I had experience when the boss are chat via WhatsApp in the midnight of Saturday and want to create some “project” that launch at Sunday morning ( 6 hour after the WA chat). Insane right? It creates FOMO and paranoid when you look at your phone.

2. Data driven in the employee decision but, intuition driven for the boss. 1 sentece from your boss mouth in the meeting can negate all your research findings.

3. Everybody snatching for spotlight. Gojek always said about teamwork but, What I look at is everybody are snatching spotlight for one of another to impress the boss. It's hard to look at a humble leader or employee. The politic inside it are so strong.

4. Critic is a give principle are BS. I often look at employee especially across division or position are blaming one after another in the meetings. I think when you're want to critic someone it's better to do it personally and with the mindset to help him/her not to shamming them in public.

5. Too many foreigner in high position and they didn't know the Indonesian customer or employee culture. 

6. Uncertainty of job functional and lack of career path development. Gojek always said ""Flat"" structure but, in my experience it's very hierarchy. You can't talk to other division VP without permission of your VP. It's better if 1 VP talk  to another VP. This regulation are creating so much stress when your deadline are near.

At least in GO-PAY, there are some team leads who do not care about your career growth or what you want to do. They are greedy and will just push you to do some tasks which will make them look good for promotions. They also dont care if you address your concerns during the reviews.

Moreover, they are not supportive / understanding of the devs in their team at all. They breed a TOXIC environment and it will lead to mental health problems and anxiety. At least this was what happened to me. If you happen to join such a team, please point out your frustrations immediately and dont wait till the review cycles. Escalate your problems ASAP. In GO-PAY particularly, the top tech management is good and cares about the everyday devs. But the middle level (sub-team leads / team leads are the definition of TOXIC). This kind of culture is expected when you promote inexperienced people quickly. Also expect rude slack messages from them.

Also, the toxicity of some team leads does not limit to a professional setting. They do not understand the concept of separating personal life from professional life. 
One particular team lead befriended me on all social media platforms - Tinder etc. Started talking about how knew my friends and ""hooked up"" with them. I did not know this person was going to be my manager at the time and passed it off as just casual banter. But when things went south, he made sure the project I was in and my performance in the team suffered. I had to endure a lot of anxiety and depression because of this. When I did raise this concern in the review, they brushed it aside.

EmployerReviewRG,"- Focus on outcomes, and not just delivery.
- Measure business impact for product teams, Vs # of features shipped
- Find the right balance between top-down and bottom-up work culture
- Set the right expectations while hiring
- Please hire seasoned leadership, and build an inclusive work culture at the leadership level","I was at GoJek for around a year - Built out and launched key products, interacted directly with CEO/ CXO/ SVP/ leadership. Few observations :

-  Lack of data-driven decision making - There's no culture of evidence (qualitative/ quantitative) based product strategy. Just ideas made up in the air based on ""visionary thinking of the CEO"" or some hearsay/ article read by some SVP.  They'd change their decisions over the fly over a couple of Whatsapp conversations without full context of the decision.

- Project Management (and not Product management) - When I joined, I was pleasantly surprised that GoJek got so big with the current product culture - but after a few months, I realised that the success of GoJek was its ability replicate US/ India/ China models in a greenfield market like Indonesia really quickly. Not focusing on innovation, but focusing on rapid replication + delivery. Not focusing on iterative experimentation, but just speed of shipping features. Works/ worked for Indonesia, but detrimental to the growth of a Product manager's leadership/ analytical thinking.

- *Very* hierarchal - The decisions are pushed downwards from the SVP/ GM/ CXO, and the Senior Product managers act like Project managers executing a mandate given from the top. It was sad to see limited bottom-up input in Product strategy (akin to Chinese product work culture).

- Lack of management &amp; top-tech exposure at the leadership level - Although there's a lot of fan-fare around how the CEO is a game-changer for Indonesia (and maybe its true from an Indonesian context), I believe there's a lack of management/ leadership at the CXO/ SVP level. Few in the senior leadership have exposure working at Top-tech companies (FAANG/ Tier 2 Tech) previously, leading to a lack of understanding around how to build product teams, and building the right product culture.

- Indo favouritism at the leadership level - There's a sense of favouritism if you're an Indonesian at the leadership level. That's an accepted fact across the company (and sometimes even acknowledged by the leadership in the name of patriotism) - but is very unhealthy and non-inclusive in the long run.

Lots of areas of improvement for Gojek.
